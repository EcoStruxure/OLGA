# OLGA: an Ontology SDK

## Welcome !
OLGA (Ontology Library GenerAtor) is a generic tool aiming to accelerate the adoption of [Standard W3C Semantic technology](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) among developers. 

OLGA provides a better development experience by focusing on:

* Reducing friction barrier for developers when working with an ontology model.

* Accelerating development of ontology based systems.

* Eliminating complexity by providing Object Oriented libraries for developers.

OLGA is based on a model driven approach taking as input an ontology file expressed in one of the supported W3C supported standards ([RDF](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/RDF), [OWL](https://www.w3.org/OWL)) and generating a library conform to the ontology model.

The generated library is then imported and used to programmatically to:
1. Generate an ontology instance conform to the ontology model.
2. Query the generated ontology instance by relying on Object Oriented Model instead of [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/).

OLGA is licensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE.TXT).
Schneider Electric requests contributions to be provided back to benefit the community.
